## About Me   

I’m a **data analyst** with a master’s in data analytics and a background in teaching.  
I love digging into data, spotting patterns, and turning them into insights people can actually use.  
At the core, my work is about translating complex information into **stories and solutions that drive impact**.   

Outside of data, you’ll usually find me outdoors hiking or recharging through mindfulness.  
Staying active and grounded fuels my passion for balance, which I bring into both my personal life and professional work.
