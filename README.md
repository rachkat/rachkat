## 👋 About Me  

I’m a **data analyst** with a master’s in data analytics and a background in teaching.  
I enjoy digging into data, spotting patterns, and turning them into insights people can actually use.  
My work is about translating complex data into **stories and solutions that matter**.

**Data Analysis & Exploration:** Statistical modeling, forecasting, hypothesis testing, and data cleaning with Python, R, and Excel  

**SQL & Databases:** Writing complex queries, joins, aggregations, and optimizing relational database performance  

**Data Visualization & BI:** Building interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau, Power BI, and Excel to inform decision-making and storytelling  

**Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics:** Applying supervised learning, regression, and classification models to solve real-world problems and support risk analytics  

**ETL & Data Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data to ensure accuracy, integrity, and scalability in analytics workflows  

**Business & Strategy:** Dashboard design, business intelligence reporting, data governance, compliance, problem-solving, and stakeholder communication

### 📚 From Teaching to Data  
I started in education, mainly math and science, which gave me a knack for explaining complex ideas simply.  
That skill translates directly into analytics — breaking down technical results for stakeholders or collaborating across teams.  

### 🌿 A Bit More About Me  
When I’m not analyzing datasets, you’ll probably find me hiking or outdoors, recharging through nature and mindfulness.  
Staying active and grounded fuels my passion for wellness — a balance I also bring to my professional work.
