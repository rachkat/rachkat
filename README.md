## About Me   

I’m a data analyst with a master’s in data analytics and a background in teaching.
I enjoy exploring data, uncovering patterns, and transforming them into insights that people can act on.
At the core, my work is about turning complex information into clear stories and practical solutions that drive impact.

Outside of data, you’ll find me experimenting in the kitchen, running or hiking outdoors, and recharging through mindfulness.
Staying active and grounded gives me the calm, curiosity, and determination I carry into my professional work.
