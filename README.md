## About Me   

I’m a **data analyst** with a master’s in data analytics and a background in teaching.  
I love digging into data, spotting patterns, and turning them into insights people can actually use.  
At the core, my work is about translating complex information into **stories and solutions that drive impact**.   

Outside of data, you’ll usually find me outdoors hiking or recharging through mindfulness.  
Staying active and grounded fuels my passion for balance, which I bring into both my personal life and professional work.

## Projects  

#### Monte Carlo Simulation — Capital Modeling
**[View Repo](https://github.com/rachkat/monte-carlo-capital-modeling)** · *(PDF in repo: `monte_carlo_capital_modeling.pdf`)*

- Modeled annual collision losses with a **compound Poisson** Monte Carlo (frequency ~ Poisson, per-event severity ~ Lognormal).
- Ran **10k–100k simulations** to estimate tail capital (VaR) at **99%, 99.5%, and 99.9%**, with notes on model/assumption sensitivity.
- Delivered clean, reproducible **R** code and visualizations (loss distribution with 99.9% marker) for stakeholder-ready risk insights.

#### Walmart Facility Location — South Korea vs. Russia
**[View Repo](https://github.com/rachkat/walmart-facility-location)** · *(PDF in repo: `walmart_facility_location_proposal.pdf`)*

- Compared **South Korea vs. Russia** using a **Factor Rating Method** (logistics, labor, market, stability); **recommended South Korea**.
- Identified constraints (port congestion, customs, urban traffic) and mitigations (night moves, multi-sourcing, predictive scheduling).
- Designed warehousing strategy: **automation**, **lean/JIT**, **cross-docking**, and **co-location** with manufacturing; **pull-led** inventory with strategic **push**.
- Embedded quality & governance: **TQM** and **Six Sigma** to improve service levels and cost efficiency.
