## 👋 About Me   

I’m a **data analyst** with a master’s in data analytics and a background in teaching.  
I love digging into data, spotting patterns, and turning them into insights people can actually use.  
At the core, my work is about translating complex information into **stories and solutions that drive impact**.  

My career began in education, teaching math and science, which gave me a talent for breaking down complex ideas in simple, clear ways.  
That same skill now fuels my analytics work — whether I’m explaining technical results to stakeholders or collaborating across teams.  

Outside of data, you’ll usually find me outdoors hiking or recharging through mindfulness.  
Staying active and grounded fuels my passion for balance, which I bring into both my personal life and professional work.
